# Example run files

* The file `run.jl` launches a run with Gaussian-like initial
data (that is, with a Gaussian pulse for the $\Psi_4$ field).

* The file `run_qnm.jl` launches a run with quasinormal mode initial
data, which can be found in the `qnm` directory. 
The quasinormal mode initial data was generated with the
[TeukolskyQNMFunctions.jl](https://github.com/JLRipley314/TeukolskyQNMFunctions.jl)
code.
